My parents were in the Salvation Army and I was quite\n            keen on reading the Bible when I was a child, partly because I enjoyed learning about\n            ancient cultures like the Egyptians and the Greeks and Romans.  I also greatly admired\n            Jesus and some of the prophets for speaking out against corrupt, hypocritical rulers and \n            religious authorities.</p>\n          <p>In my late teens and early twenties I got increasingly interested in paganism, astrology\n            and the occult.  I still considered myself a christian as well as a pagan at the time,\n            and my paganism was a weird creation of my own, involving the elements and astrological related\n            deties.  I was also strongly influenced by Linda Goodman at this time.\n          </p>\n          <p>In my mid and late twenties I rejected anything too superstitious and focused more and more\n            on philsophy.  I stopped believing in Jesus's divinity at about the age of 21, viewing him\n            as a spiritually enlightened man (like the Buddha of the west).  At that time I started viewing\n            all religions as containing elements of truth but obscured by human folly and misunderstanding.\n            As time went by and got more and more into philosophy, I became ever more rational in my beliefs, \n            and no longer believed in a human soul (personality is in the brain).  I became a pantheist and a \n            panpsychist at this time.\n          </p>\n          <p>In 2007 I became an atheist.  I finally reasoned that even consciousness is readily \n            explicable as the processing of information in our brains and there's nothing mysterious about it.\n           I stopped beleiving in God or gods, I stopped believing in life after death, I stopped believing in anything\n           supernatural. \n          </p>\n          <p>But my sprituality returned.  In 2010 I started praying again.  I realised I needed a spiritual practice\n            to feel whole and emotionally balanced.  I started to believe there was a mysterious presence in nature\n            that you can interact with and draw strength and wisdom from.  An image that seemed perfect\n            for this kind of very nature based understanding of deity was Cernunnos, the antlered celtic (and possibly prehistoric)\n            god of the forests and wild animals.\n          </p>\n          <p>Indian ideas, from both Buddhism and Hinduism, had been a powerful influence on my spirituality before,\n            and it was Hinduism I turned to at first when I wanted to expand my spiritual practice to \n            include symbolic representations of different aspects of the divine, of nature and of human experience.\n            If all things are God then this makes a lot of sense.  I also justified it as finding balance\n            between the rational and poetic parts of my mind.  This makes sense.  If you're doing science\n            then you need to be as rational and objective as possible.  If you're trying to find peace of mind\n            and purpose and balance in your life then it makes sense to honour your human needs, including\n            the not so rational ones.  We are creatures of story and community after all, not just logic\n            and ingenuity.  It's not really that rational to deny the validity of an important part of our human nature. \n          </p>\n          <p>Eventually I became an eclectic pagan, drawing from Celtic, Greek and Egyptian mythology as well as Hinduism.\n            More recently still, I have embraced the Greek pantheon as the one that speaks to me most.\n            But I am still a pantheist at heart.  The gods are but symbols.  And the antlered god of the celts\n            still resonates strongly with me.\n          </p>\n          <button onClick={() => setPage(page-3)}>back to main page</button>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    if (page === 4) {\n      return (\n        <div className = \"lgbt_page\">\n          <h2>My gender and sexuality</h2>\n          <p>I'm a transgender woman and am very active in local transgender groups and online\n            ]communities.\n          </p>\n          <p>I'm bisexual and have had both male and female partners in the past.\n            I much prefer women but am definitely flexible about the gender of my partners.\n          </p>\n          <p>I'm sexually submissive.  Not so much into pain and bondage, although I do like\n            some aspects of it.  Mostly my kinks are psychological/roleplay based or to do with\n            certain fetishes.  I am definitely submissive or a bottom.  That's just the way my desires work.\n          </p>\n          <p>I'm also polyamorous.  I am open to having multiple partners and am also open to\n            my partners having other partners.  As long as there is compassion, honesty and openness to \n            communication around any emotional difficulties, there is no reason why many partners cannot\n            find a loving and secure situation with each other.  Monogamy feels too limiting\n            to me these days.  I want to be loved for all of me, and that includes the fact that\n            I may well have desires for multiple people.  I can't simply turn off my interest\n            in and affection for other people, nor do I feel like I should do.  Monogamy also seems\n            too much pressure.  You have to be everything for that person.  Sometimes people have\n            complicated needs that can't be fulfilled by just one person.  And that's ok.  Monogamy\n            can also be scarily isolating in abusive, toxic situations.  Of course polyamory can also\n            be scarily rootless and unsettling in abusive, toxic situations.  Jealousy is a natural\n            human emotion, as troublesome as it might be, and I wouldn't trust anyone that says\n            you should ignore, dismiss or try to suppress it.  Communication is the key.  Talk about it,\n            work out ways of reassuring each other, be honest, respectful, warm and compassionate with each\n            other at all times, and there's no reason why polyamory shouldn't be just as \n            succesful a relationship style as monogamy.  The time someone spends with someone else\n            shouldn't necessarily affect the quality of time you spend with that person, and the quality\n            of the relationship you have with that person is what really matters.\n          </p>\n          <button onClick={() => setPage(page-4)}>back to main page</button>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    if (page === 5) {\n      return (\n        <div className=\"creativity_pages\">\n          <h2>My writing</h2>\n          <p>I write fantasy and science fiction stories.</p>\n          <p>I self-publish on Amazon:</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kim-McLelland/e/B084FGQVS3\" target =\"_blank\">Check out my work here</a>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"buttons\">\n            <button onClick={() => setPage(page-3)}>back to creativity</button>\n            <button onClick={() => setPage(page-5)}>back to main page</button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    if (page === 6) {\n      return (\n        <div className=\"creativity_pages\">\n          <h2>My music</h2>\n          <p>I have also written songs on my guitar and keyboard.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-695633336\" target =\"_blank\">check out my soundcloud</a>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"buttons\">\n            <button onClick={() => setPage(page-4)}>back to creativity</button>\n            <button onClick={() => setPage(page-6)}>back to main page</button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    if (page === 7) {\n      return (\n        <div className=\"creativity_pages\">\n          <h2>My videos</h2>\n          <p>I have a youtube channel:</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99jri8yyuD4yVRnFiJqdRQ\" target =\"_blank\">FaerieKim's youtube channel</a>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"buttons\">\n            <button onClick={() => setPage(page-5)}>back to creativity</button>\n            <button onClick={() => setPage(page-7)}>back to main page</button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    if (page === 8) {\n      return (\n        <div className=\"creativity_pages\">\n          <h2>Coding</h2>\n          <p>I love coding.
